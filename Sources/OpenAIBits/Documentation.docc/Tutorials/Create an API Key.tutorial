        In order to access the API, you will need to provide an API Key with each request.

            Calling the OpenAI API requires a unique key that is linked to an OpenAI account.

                Navigate to the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) section of the OpenAI site.
                
                > Note: If you need to, [create an account](doc:Create-an-Account) or sign in.

                Click the `"Create new secret key"` button to generate a new key.

            }
            
            @Step {
                The new key is generated. This will be the only time the full key is available to copy.

            }
            
            @Step {
              Copy the generated key, and save it in whatever location you will access it from.
              
              > Important: Do not store the key in a public location such as a GitHub repository. Not only is it giving anyone access to charge the account for use of the API, but OpenAI will automatically invalidate any public keys it finds on the Internet.
